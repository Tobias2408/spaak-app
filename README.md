## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

Database Setup
To set up the database connection:

Go to your .env file and set up your database connection details, such as DATABASE_URL or any other required configuration values.
Once configured, refer to the API Documentation for endpoints and setup details specific to your database.
This ensures that your API routes are connected and can interact with your database correctly.

API Documentation
This project includes API documentation with Swagger. You can access the documentation locally once the server is running:

Swagger UI: http://localhost:3000/api/swagger-ui
This documentation provides detailed information on available API endpoints, request parameters, and response structures. Use this to verify your database setup and explore the available API functionality.
