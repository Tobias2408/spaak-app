# Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

API Documentation
This project includes API documentation with Swagger. You can access the documentation locally once the server is running:

Swagger UI: http://localhost:3000/api/swagger-ui
This documentation provides detailed information on available API endpoints, request parameters, and response structures.
